switch work look leap switch travel greater standard way switch use common fender replacement control plate one intended way switch may not fit could fairly easily alter plate want cleanest look possible may want investigate new control plate make sure control plate fit,1
recently building telecaster project friend recommended using way switch instead stock way switch allows three position normally found telecaster bridge bridge neck parallel neck also add ability add setting bridge neck pickup series result added position get higher volume output guitar regular bridge neck position slightly higher top end output clearly case mileage may vary used traditional position switch telecaster bit indifferent mod building another guitar would probably use switch supposed within couple dollar way however would not change working way switch added benefit worth effort great modified telecaster,2
four way diagram come switch not tell side use side five tab look diagram given matter way turn figured would go way three way wrong think fender would sense figure give u proper diagram guess another example incompetence fender improper wiring diagram,1

knob balanced out volume knob thing could work around current monitor seem susceptible ground loop even ground lift plug needed go balanced cable glad balanced cable completely eliminated noise problem good purchase however would say anyone need balanced cable budget consider behringer tiny fraction price work pretty well class complaint use behringer driver plug play good thing say focusrite scarlett hardware bad thing software tried using driver version came disk udpated downloaded focusrite website let know need interface balanced stereo high quality headphone amp volume knob headphone amp main line good digital analog conversion low output latency input latency not important use mic preamps one big selling point device good box simple well designed want convenient control high build quality pleased digital analog conversion great big volume knob another headphone amp switch input line microphone pre amp switch zero latency monitoring whatever coming headphone amp particular concern use headphone lot poor headphone amp quite problem behringer headphone amp ok specifically output impedance ohm rule thumb good headphone amp matching output impedance impedance headphone hd ohm impedance breaking rule get distortion frequency response case mostly meant attenuation bass manufacturer list output impedance possibly embarrassed anyway focusrite one reason trust little output impedance le ohm respectable not amazing still not low would need principle notice improvement bass response headphone plenty extra voltage could drive higher impedance can necessary anyway good headphone amp check balanced in out work well in accommodates trs style xlr light around show something actually coming shine red danger clipping lot gain available turned way almost out trs style balanced unbalanced located back like look box red metal case front back sturdy attractive well usb cable type b port mean replace get damaged whatever behringer example hard wired cable king annoying bus powered actually would fine wall wart even simple really complaint whatsoever hardware bad driver thing horrible window xp clean installation nothing installed except daw software acrobat reader driver mean computer really stripped performance using behringer good latency time playing note hearing speaker m using behringer really perceptible unfortunately focusrite driver though technically asio apparently anything like acceptable latency lowest latency could set get sound instead crackle pop m level instrument begin sound sluggish laggy difficult least work large latency like ready return device decided last ditch effort install asioall sort asio driver use absolutely not make manufacturer driver perform decent level installed worked output latency tiny m actually output latency really impressive conclude hardware good machine software horrible unfortunately actually uninstall focusrite driver otherwise window recognize device never even turn not class

behringer driver always worked moved interface one usb port longer recognized reinstall driver however use behringer driver asioall would give m perform without complication trouble free seen type device read presonus audiobox usb audio fast track pro probably two closest competitor focusrite get bunch comment like one horrible horrible driver never get fixed actually mackie make competitor well onyx blackjack review show driver possibly even worse one unfortunately none pro music manufacturer care driver live unstable system work half time maybe better mac know interestingly really usb device range quite shocking considering long usb standard around real implication usb device like audio presonus two channel audio not time not enough throughput usb light competition focusrite look kind ok unfortunately audio interface manufacturer least range device think need good hardware especially good software least hardware one spec cross finger improved driver future bottom line fantastic star device make software work consistently tight budget care balanced recommend go behringer uca ufo ton cheaper class complaint better driver use high impedance headphone even headphone amp pretty good one update may new version driver came since writing new driver actually work stopped using asioall get decent latency not often inexplicably require edit setting increase buffer percentage time reboot computer change anything time work ok would never use mission critical setting e gigging pro work home use good enough issue driver definitely update excellent hardware horrible
